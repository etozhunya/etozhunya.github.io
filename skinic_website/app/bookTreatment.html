					In most cases, the treatment effect occurs after 1-3 days. After 7-14 days the full effect (and thus the treated area) reveals itself. It rarely takes longer before the result appears. However, according to specialist information, the maximum effect occurs after 5-6 weeks.
					<br><br>
					The effect generally lasts 3-6 months. However, this is on an individual basis and also depends on the treated area. The duration of the result also depends on the injected dose and the existing muscle activity and mass. Avoiding a mask-like face, also called ‘frozen face’, is contrary to the desire for a prolonged botulinum effect. We recommend moderate doses of botulinum for a natural result. Before treatment, professional advice and information is a must. Furthermore, a strategic treatment plan for anti-wrinkle treatment or prevention needs to be worked out together with the client.
